# Samsung-Preparation
## Online Round Preparation

This tutorial is meant to provide support to all the talented coders who are preparing for Samsung FTE. I have collected all the previously asked questions in Samsung's online test and written a solution of my own. I hope this will also be beneficial for people preparing for product based companies. Samsung does not allow libraries like STL(C++) and Collections Framework(Java) to be used while writing the code. So, you need to implement all the Data Structures and their related functionalities. The codes which I have written doesn't use any of these libraries except for basic I/O. :)
